# ApplicationController
# =====================
#  - Represents the top-level controller for our application
#  - A controller will **inherit** from Sinatra::Base
class ApplicationController < Sinatra::Base

    # Since we are writing a non-standard Sinatra application
    # (a.k.a. we are writing it with folders and a modular pattern),
    # we need to say where the root is and where the app is supposed
    # to find its views.
    set :root, File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..')
    set :views, File.join(root, "views")
  end
